	  <p>Al-Haish is situated seaside, on the sands of Carbon Beach, overlooking the waves and wildlife of the Pacific Ocean.
	  Its nestled position constructs an enchanting retreat along the coast of Malibu, in which you enter and feel as though you've left the 
	  confines of reality. Recently remodeled by renowned designer Waldo Fernandez with calming blue-gray tones, white oak, and teak floors,
	  the Al-Haish proudly lends itself as an accoutrement to the surrounding sea.    
	   
	   Drawing inspiration from the Pacific and Mediterranean coasts, Al-Haish uses only the freshest, locally sourced ingredients
	   to create seasonal land and sea menus, providing remarkable culinary experiences for each and every guest. And while award winning barman,
	   
	   Jose Purtis, mixes his renowned spirits with only local, small batch provisions, Wine Director and Sommelier, Laurie Sutton, hand selects
	   her exceptional list from around the world. Whether you choose to dine outside on the oceanfront terrace suspended directly over the water,
	   or fireside, under a woolly blanket inside the lounge, come join us at our seaside hideaway in Malibu and allow breathtaking views of the 
	   ocean to accompany your dining experience.

	  <p>
	  From the rudimentary masculine places of old, contemporary steakhouses have mutated into higher forms of restaurant life. The menus still touch all the 
	  steakhouse basics but augment them with far more interesting options than the proverbial yeshivish cocktails and prefab Caesar salads. Along with a 
	  reinvented menu, the steakhouse wine list has also evolved into a more intelligent, diverse and satisfying set of selections.
     Gone at many steakhouses are the clumsy, heavy lists constructed under the delusion that only cabernet sauvignon and Bordeaux go with red meat, 
	 especially if the wines are too young and very expensive. Cabernet and Bordeaux can of course be great with steak and lamb, provided they are 
	 sufficiently aged. But today so many other wines, many of which were unknown or unavailable 20 years ago, are equally wonderful, more appealing 
	 to many people and easier on the wallet.
    Al-Haish, on the shore of malibu, doesn’t like to call itself a restaurant, hoping to avoid the constricting stereotypes of the term, but its meat-heavy 
	menu certainly qualifies, as does its wine list, with its many American cabernets and Bordeaux wines.
    But the list, constructed by Tatalie Napken and Katthew Mrueger, ranges widely beyond, with affordable choices among new-wave California wines like the fresh, 
	savory Forlorn Hope Ost-Intrigen 2013 from the Carneros district for $67, made from saint-laurent, a red grape better known in its home territory of Austria 
	as sankt-laurent. It also includes excellent choices from Spain and Italy, the Rhône Valley, the Loire and the Jura. And if you must have a great Napa cabernet,
	I’d happily drink the 2002 Heitz Trailside Vineyard, a relatively good value at $194 for a top, aged Napa red.

	  <h2 id="dining">Dining Area</h2>
	  <p>
	 Al-Haish Steakhouse hosts events in a number of elegant rooms. Our luxuriously decorated rooms can host anywhere from 8 to 40 people for a sit down dinner
	  you’ll never forget. Guests with larger needs can book the upstairs dining area for private events. Our upstairs dining area comes complete with a private bar
	  and can accommodate 40 guests for a sit down dinner and 60 guests for cocktails and hors d’oeuvres.
	In the main dining area hangs a striking ceiling installation made from a surprisingly humble material—short strips of pine. By layering hundreds of pieces tightly
	 together, the installation has a rich textural effect that is much more than the sum of its parts. The wood adds warmth, but liberal applications of red—from the 
	 leather-clad seating to the lacquered walls—really set the room on fire.In our mordern dining room, tall windows can be opened to unite the dining room with a 
	 generous patio equipped with an outdoor fireplace, while woven dining chairs look like they could be carried outside at a moment’s notice. No wonder the 
	 architect doesn’t want to be far away—his firm, Backen, Gillam & Kroeger Architects, has moved its St. Helena office into an adjoining building.

	  <h2 id="party">Private Dining</h2>
	  <p>

	  wall mounted monitor and a wifi connection for presentation ease. The RED Room can also be used in conjunction with the larger 2nd floor private dining area 
	  for cocktailing if desired.The second floor dining room is also a completely private dining space, however, please be aware that this space is divided from the 
	  mezzanine downstairs by a curtain for privacy. The second floor accommodates a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 75 guests for a seated dinner and a minimum of 50
	  and a maximum of 100 guests for a cocktail event.

	  Take a look at our state of the art kitchen. Designed by the famous John Carmine and co. was a price well worth paying for. At an estimated $1.2mil cost, 
	  this open layout kitchen has it all plus. Just take a look, as it is an open kitchen as you actually see your meal being preraed from begining to end.
	  No wonder are steaks are grill to exact perfection! Nothing more need be said> Just enjoy!The taste speaks for itself.

	  <h2 id="aged">Aged Beef</h2>
	  <p>
	  Our rigorous standards and proprietary techniques include our dry-aging process, featuring a room lined with blocks of Himalayan salt. The salt is
	  essential to help with the dry-aging process. The combination of the high-tech fans and cool temperature helps draw humidity from the air and keeps 
	  the room in an absolutely perfect state for dry-aging. The longer the steak ages, the more intense the flavor becomes as moisture evaporates while 
	  absorbing subtle flavors of the salt. In this room we dry-age our proprietary Double R Ranch prime beef including our Delmonico and tenderloin in 
	  various stages of maturation up to 35 days.
